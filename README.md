# cloud-simulations-overview
Overview of all cloud engineering simulations I have completed (Verizon, AWS APAC /Forage ) and simulations in progress (Coursevita DevOps, Anthropos Cost Optimization). Individual detailed repositories will be published soon.
# 📘 Cloud Simulations Overview (WIP)

This repository provides a structured overview of all cloud engineering and technical support simulations I have completed or am currently working on.  
Each simulation will be published as a standalone repository progressively.
